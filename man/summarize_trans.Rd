Summarize results obtained with phyloscanner.
}
\details{
Here we summarized the results obtained with phyloscanner.
   The summary is based on the summary results that phyloscanner returns
   in which it summarizes the "ancestry" type by window.
   We consired that two individuals are linked if proportion of values for
   ancestry is complex, multiTrans and trans are >= 0.50
   On the other hand, we considered that two individuals represent a true
   direction of transmission from host.1 to host.2 if the proportion of
   multiTrans and trans are >= 0.375. These cut-off values were based on
   Zhang et al.Clin Infect Dis. 2021 Jan 1; 72(1): 30â€“37.
   Note that to carry out this summary, we pre-removed all
   ancestry = noAncestry.
